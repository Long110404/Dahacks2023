Fall 2023 Admission For this Major: 
Transfer students who select this major on their College of Letters and Science (L&S) application and are offered admission to 
L&S will be directly admitted into this major. No additional steps are required to be admitted to the major

If you are interested in this major, it is very important to select this major on your application. If you do not select this major on 
your application, it may not be possible for you to declare this major at a later date. Complete as many lower-division major 
requirements as possible prior to transfer. See details on course preparation for this major below.

DATA SCIENCE is a new field of study that combines computational and inferential reasoning to draw conclusions based on data 
about some aspect of the real world. Data scientists come from all walks of life, all areas of study, and all backgrounds. They 
share an appreciation for the practical use of mathematical and scientific thinking and the power of computing to understand and 
solve problems for business, research, and societal impact.

The Data Science Major will equip students to draw sound conclusions from data in context, using knowledge of statistical 
inference, computational processes, data management strategies, domain knowledge, and theory. Students will learn to carry out 
analyses of data through the full cycle of the investigative process in scientific and practical contexts. Students will gain 
understanding of the human and ethical implications of data analysis and integrate that knowledge in designing and carrying out 
their work.

We strongly encourage you to visit our website for prospective transfer students (link listed below) to learn more about 
preparing for a major in Data Science at UC Berkeley.  Also, please reach out to us via the email address below if you have 
specific questions about your academic path into data science.

A note about CS 61B / “Articulation subject to completion of a university course”
Any course/s approved as comparable to COMPSCI 61B must include coverage of object-oriented programming, hashing, heaps, 
priority queues and graphs, together with at least one programming assignment of 1000 or more lines of code. If any of these 
topics are missing, the missing material may be acquired by taking a bridge course, COMPSCI 47B, at UC Berkeley. If you see 
"Articulation subject to completion of a university course'" below the community college course, then in addition to completing 
the community college course, you must complete COMPSCI 47B after enrollment at UC Berkeley.
